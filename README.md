This project aims to accurately classify handwritten numerical whole numbers 0 to 9 using both ANN and CNN. 
It was implemented using TensorFlow and keras modules available on Jupyter Lab.
The dataset used has data split into into testing and training data for convenience.
Each handwritten digit is represented using a 28x28 grid of pixels ranging from 0-255, with white and black corresponding to 0 and 255 respectively.
